          <p>The great enemy of a Growth Culture is busy-ness.</p>
          <p>When we first work with clients, the pattern looks like this: They love the idea of investing in their people, there are definitely some arenas that need serious attention, and people have been asking for this stuff for a long time. It's just... you know... there's a lot going on right now... we just brought on a new client... we're merging offices... there are some restructures happening with the creative team... as soon as we get through [fill-in-the-blank] then we'll be ready to get going.</p>
          <p>Don't fall for the perfect timing trap. It will never be the perfect time. You will never have the perfect plan. And if you wait for perfect, you will never start.</p>
          <p>Want to know a secret? The best time to start a Growth Culture is precisely when things are crazy.</p>
          <p>A Growth Culture, as we've described it, is fundamentally a sense-making process. It helps you make sense of what's happening in your business, learn from it, and change the way you operate.</p>
          <p>When things are calm, sense-making isn't that important. When things are crazy, a Growth Culture helps you respond more effectively to the chaos. People feel more grounded and connected. Problems are sorted with greater insight.</p>
          <p>You don't need a comprehensive plan to get started. You don't need to conquer this entire process all at once.</p>
          <p>Instead, embrace "permanent beta". The process will never be complete. Your Growth Culture will always be a work in progress.</p>
Your agency is not a mechanism—it's an organism. It's not a machine you fix only when it breaks down. Like the body, it requires regular exercise to stay healthy. Like a garden, it must be tended daily.
Pick some small part of the process and run some experiments. Set a simple cadence for running these experiments—somewhere between two weeks and two months—and then retro what you learned. Write it down. Update your plan. Then run another experiment.
If you're stuck for places to start experimenting, here are a few suggestions.
Establish some baseline data. Create a simple survey and send it to everyone at the agency. Ask their opinion on the current state of the Growth Culture. Include multiple-choice questions that will give you objective data to compare over time, and some open-ended questions that will generate ideas for improvement. As a bonus, the survey sends a signal that you're serious about their development.
Update some role descriptions. Pick one team and try to rewrite their role descriptions using skills and activities. Then group them around the value chain of the team or agency. Three or four job descriptions should be enough to learn a whole lot about this process. Share the updated descriptions with a few people outside the team and get feedback.
Prototype some mastery levels. Create a simple, 5-level framework of mastery levels. Give each level a name and a description of about 25 words. Then sit down with 3-5 people and use this framework to talk through their current job. Is it helpful? Can they clearly identify their level of mastery? Does it inspire them to get better? Adjust the language as needed every time you do this until it starts to work for everyone.
Introduce a new practice to one team. Hold a Journey meeting. Create a commit. Write a daily reflection. Pick some practice described in the Developing section and ask a team to try it out for a couple weeks. Check in with them often. Ask them what they're noticing. Document that. Tweak as needed until it's effective. Then have them introduce that practice to another team.
The fastest way to get started is to just start. Another approach is to...
